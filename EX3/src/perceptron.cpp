// All Perceptron functionality is implemented as inline/template
// members in the header (`perceptron.hpp`). Keeping this source file
// minimal prevents illegal out-of-class specializations and duplicate
// definitions while allowing the build system to compile a unit for
// the perceptron translation unit if needed.
